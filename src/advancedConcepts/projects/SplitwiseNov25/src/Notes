Bi-directional and uni-directional

Uni-directional mapping
------------------------
Expense [ description, amount ]
PayoutLedger [ user, amount, payoutType, expense ]

OR

Expense [ description, amount, list<payoutLedger> ]
PayoutLedger [ user, amount, payoutType ]

Bi-directional mapping
------------------------
Expense [ description, amount, list<payoutLedger> ]
PayoutLedger [ user, amount, payoutType, expense ]

Example -
Uni-directional mapping
------------------------
Expense [ description, amount ]
PayoutLedger [ user, amount, payoutType, expense ]

if we query for expense -> get/expense/{id} -> only scans expense table
if we query for payoutLedget -> get/payout/{id} -> 2 scans, payoutLedgerTable and expense table

Bi-directional mapping
------------------------
Expense [ description, amount, list<payoutLedger> ]
PayoutLedger [ user, amount, payoutType, expense ]

if we query for anyone, both the tables are scanned and appropriate response is received
